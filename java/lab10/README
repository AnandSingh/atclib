1. Do programming project 11.1 on page 497 of your book
(a) Do NOT use the sort() methods in Java Arrays;
(b) Develop the code for the sort methods as discussed during the lecture and in the book;
(c) Perform the sort using three algorithms: Selection sort, Insertion sort, and Bubble Sort.
(d) Use the "natural" ordering of the object being sorted (i.e., have the object being sorted extend the Comparable interface and sort according to instructions given on page 497);
(e) Use the test data given in the book on page 498; you may add more rows to your test data if you want.


Assignment Files: 

	Lab10SortPerson.java 
	FileOp.java 
	ComparePersonFile.java

Compile: 

$ javac Lab10SortPerson.java
$ javac FileOp.java
$ javac ComparePersonFile.java

Run:

$ java Lab10SortPerson


Optional File: 

	GenerateRandomPersonFile.java
	This is used to genaret an random number of secrity number to be tested with main programs	
	

Note:

This programs takes the user input for file path. The file should conatins as per below specification 
Last_Name<space>First_Name<space>Middle_name<space>Security_NUMBER

e.g.

  Johnson Kevin Michael 222222222
  Johnson Kevin Michael 555555555
  Kiriyeva Marina Alice 333333333

*** For testing "person.dat" file can be used which has the test data as per the book. 
*** For testing "p.dat" can be used which is sgernarted via GenerateRandomPersonFile.java
